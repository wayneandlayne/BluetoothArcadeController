This is the demo code that was used at the 2011 World Maker Faire NYC. It was used with an Android tablet running the "Cordy" game demo, connected to a 4-way joystick mapped to the four arrow keys, and six pushbuttons in two rows, mapped (by row) to space (for jump) and "." (the action key). This mapping is controlled by the large mapping array, using USB HID spec keycodes (link to documentation provided in code file).
